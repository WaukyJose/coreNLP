I use cell phone, tablet, computer in my daily life, and other things for my work. as GPS to travel, POS Systems to do sell with credit card, and sometimes a translator.
There are a lot of advatages of the use of the technology in the present. I think that the first and most important is that we have a life more simple, comfortable. we can do shopping in the web, everything that we like as shoes, clothing, technology, food, books, simply a lot of things. also we can use the technology to work and communicate with other business and people, all the time, anywhere in the world.
I think that principal disadvantage, is the same that the principal advantge, when we have all the things more easily, we become conformists and not struggle to achieve other goals.
Other problem is that bad people use the technology to fight. all the wars today there are commanded with technology equipment. with air planes of high spped they bomberd villages where innocent people live.
In conclusion I think that the technology is so good, but we have to know tha right way to use. Its very important that all the world understand that the use of techonolgy implies a big responsibility, and think how you can help to others.
