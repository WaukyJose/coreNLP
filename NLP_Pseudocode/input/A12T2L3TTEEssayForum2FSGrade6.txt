The cell phone use is essential for me. because it allows me to communicate quickly, just as the email quickly to send information. although like many, I dislike unwanted messages; and to communicate with my relatives abroad I make use of social networks.
Advantages of Technology. Technological advances have allowed man to develop more efficiently in the workplace, academic, scientific, family, etc.,. It allows a great development in the scientific, professional and commercial favoring a market worldwide.
Disadvantages of Technology. The disadvantages of this are: social insecurity, addiction who uses, environmental pollution, easy violation of privacy, lack of personal communication among others.
Conclusions. My conclusion is that: although technology gives us the facilities to develop ourselves more efficiently in many ways, it has brought serious consequences mainly in the familiar and the environment. because it has been used irresponsibly without thinking about the future consequences. However it is impossible to do without it in this century and those to come.
