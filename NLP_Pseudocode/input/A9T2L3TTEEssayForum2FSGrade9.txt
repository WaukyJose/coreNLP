I use technology
Technology is a tool that is being used by almost everyone in the world. Both at home and in my work, I use the cell phone, laptop, internet, projector, calculator and television.
ADVANTAGES OF TECHNOLOGY. All technological tools I use are very important. I use the cell phone to communicate from anywhere with my friends, colleagues and family. I used the laptop to sort different kinds of work for both college and for my personal use, although I'm not very good with technology. The internet has been a mainstream in my professional preparation. its wide range of information allows me to continue to innovate, but of course, with the help of the notebook. the projector is another tool that helps me in my work for the demonstration classes. the calculator accounts for complex problems faster and television to know what is happening around the globe.
DISADVANTAGES OF TECHNOLOGY. Misuse of Internet technology has brought many inconveniences to the user. because there are pages and networks that make this very dangerous tool.
CONCLUSIONS. I conclude by saying that technology is booming and knowing it to use. Is the right tool for self-education.
