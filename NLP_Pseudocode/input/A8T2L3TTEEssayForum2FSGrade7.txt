The use of Technology
Nowadays, technology is one of the most important tools that science has created. Most of the world use it in many ways. for example I use it on my cellphone everyday which helps me communicate with my family , friends and colleagues of my work. Also I use a laptop, tv, radio, and some machines for my work.
In the future we will see even more technology advances because the world progresses and has more intelligent minds that created new things. In the past there wasn't much technology and people had to do all they need by themselves. now we have the opportunity to use technology to help us in housework, at education and more. That why it's an advantage to have technology. it has made our lives easy.
Although technology is an important tool that help us in everything, also it has disadvantages. We are getting used to it and getting dependent too. We have to difference the good things from the bad. Children now prefer to play video games, watch tv or stay chatting on the phone than playing in a park or exercise. The same happens with teens and adults, technology manages their lives.
In conclusion, technology is an amazing creation. it has advantages. because it has helped us in many things and also has disadvantages for the addiction it causes. If we don't learn how to use it in the right way we would suffer later when we don't have more technology. It's important to know that we don't have to disconnect of the real life just for technology.
