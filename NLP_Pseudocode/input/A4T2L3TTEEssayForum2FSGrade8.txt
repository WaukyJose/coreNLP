The technology is used in our daily life. I use the phone in my work to receive and to send information to clients. In my studies the computer and internet is fundamental to look for information and to be informed about the activities of the university.
The development of the technology helps to obtain big advances in all the sectors, like education, health, business, communication between others. The technology allows us to be closer to our relatives that are in other countries.
The technology at not being used with wisdom and responsibility becomes an addiction. Spending lots of hours using electronic devices, turn us into sedentary and lonely people.
In conclusion as the world keeps on developing, technology will be changed, what is working today might not work not be efficient tomorrow. So it is better to stay up to date with new emerging technologies and learn how to embrace and use them in your daily life with wisdom.
