Well, I am a person that use the technology in especial the cell telephone. because now days these are very helpful and very complete they have access to internet. I can send and arrive. I can send and receive documents, images, videos and also make video calls, as technology advances every day and allows us to communicate faster long ago.
Using technology has its advantages. for example before we could only listen to people on the phone now not only you hear the voice can also view them with applications that have cell phones. we can also monitor our business with security applications.
Although, it has some disadvantages and that many people we become very dependent on the cell phone, we are always waiting for a bell to immediately pick it up and check. This takes us a long time to productive activities. in particular in our work and even the inadequate use of this has caused accidents.
I think people should make an appropriate and conscious use of technology because today is a very important to develop our activities. even help us become more productive and will bring us problems with the people around us. We may lose our jobs or lose people we love because we cannot talk face to face.
