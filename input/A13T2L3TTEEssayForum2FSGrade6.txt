The technology is a tool that help us to develop our skills. I use my cell phone and the computer so much. my phone to comunicate with every body and the computer for work. also I have a tablet but only I use it for my homeworks. All the things that we have in our environment its about techonology, tvs, radios, waves etc., and we use it always.
We have many kind of advantages, for example a faster comunication. before we used to send mails in paper and then of a few days our recipient receives. Now the mails are recived inmediatly and we have the answer at the same time. But also has disadvantages. because many people is dependent of the cell phones, tablets or cumputers. I have been with friends for lunch and they only use the cell phone since they are having lunch. this is so uncomfortable for everybody.
Another disadvantage is in kids. because they only want to use just for playing and they donÂ´t want to go out and practice any sport and this is bad. The technology is very useful. because it makes the things easier and faster we have learned a lot for many years and we can develop more technology.
