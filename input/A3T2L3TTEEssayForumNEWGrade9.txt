With the passage of time technology has become very necessary for everyday use. In my case, I have a cell phone and a tablet. I work all day in the computer at the office, and at night complete the university assignments in my computer.
The advantages of using of technology include ease of communication which flows faster for both business and for personal life. The technology helps maintain relations regardless of distance. We can obtain information from anywhere and events at the same time. People can investigate about unknown topics at the house. People can participate in work-study forum on social networks. It also helps to distract us with games, music, and videos.
The disadvantages include technological crimes, as appropriation of identity, frauds, scams, and harassment. The information could be misused by certain people. Children navigate unauthorized pages and may be victims of crime. The communication in the family increasingly is more limited. The sedentary lifestyle is fostered when people prefer to stay at home to other activities. Students do not like to read or write.
In conclusion, I think that technology is a very effective medium when what ago with restraint.
