Good morning my name is Maria Suarez, and I will speak of technology I use. I'll tell you about my favorite technological device is the cell phone, that I use every day to make calls, connect to the Internet, contact with my family abroad, via text messages. also I usually use the tablet computer, printers, USB, digital cameras, microwave, etc.
Now I will talk about the advantages of technology. They are extremely important all the advantages. these have decreased the time mail delivery. because the Internet is a fundamental part in communication in real time just as appliances such as microwave, satellite television, and others, make the life easier than before. The most important technological advances are certainly those who have given in the field of medicine, it has increased the type and length of life of people.
The disadvantages of technology are few, but the most significant is global warming. because for the manufacture of electrical devices are used, a large number of bonuses, such as copper, lead, zinc, etc. materials which are extracted from nature. Similarly the impact of cell phone and text messages, are deteriorating personal relationships between people.
My conclusions about the advantages and disadvantages of technology. First we cannot deny that technological advances have brought great changes in human welfare improving the quality of life of people. but in the same way we must understand that these advances technological should be handled in an environmentally sustainable way, not to damage the flora and fauna. they are part of our world.
